* 2016-1009: 1.4 (CliftonM) for KSP 1.2 Support
	+ Changelog
		- Recompiled to 1.2
		- Bug fixes
		- Enhanced performance
* 2016-0826: 1.3.2 (CliftonM) for KSP 1.1
	+ I did basically nothing with this, so I'm giving credit where credit is due.  Linuxgurugamer put his time into making this happen.  Note: this is an official release of his unofficial build, so it's the exact same thing as what he released.
	+ Change Log:
		- Fixed NullReferenceExceptions
		- Changed window positions (opening on top of each other)
		- Closing the main window will now close the child windows

	+ Thanks again!
* 2016-0702: 1.3.1 (CliftonM) for KSP 1.1
