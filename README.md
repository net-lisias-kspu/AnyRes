## Description

> I have gotten really tired of having to go in and edit the settings.cfg file, then restart KSP just so I can use my own custom resolution.  I decided I didn't want to have do deal with this and wrote this simple plugin to make my life easier.  I hope it can save some time!

You listened to the guy. :)
